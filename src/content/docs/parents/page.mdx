# K12Beast for Parents 👪

K12Beast helps you support your child’s K-12 education with AI-powered tutoring. This guide shows how to share learning sessions, collaborate with your child to track progress, and reward their success. Our documentation is WCAG 2.1 compliant, ensuring accessibility for all users. Let’s make learning fun and effective! 📚

## Why K12Beast for Parents? 🌟

K12Beast offers tools to engage with your child’s learning:

- *Personalized Lessons*: AI tailors content to your child’s needs.
- *Interactive Quizzes*: Fun assessments to build skills.
- *Session Sharing*: Start sessions and share them with your child or tutors.
- *Progress Tracking*: Collaborate with your child to review their cloned sessions.

## Example: Starting a Lesson 📝

Here’s how to use the [Chat](/chat) page to start a lesson:

- **You**: Can you help with a 5th-grade math lesson on fractions? See attached image of a problem my child struggles with. 📸
- **K12Beast AI**: The image shows a 5th-grade fraction problem. Here’s a lesson in an age-appropriate style. Share this session via the [Session Detail](/session/[sessionId]) page for your child to clone and work on lessons, examples, and quizzes. 🧮

## How Parents Use K12Beast 🚀

1. **Sign Up or Log In**  
   Create a free account at [Sign Up](/public/signup) or [Log In](/public/login) to start sessions.

2. **Start and Share a Session**  
   - Go to [Chat](/chat) and submit a problem (text or image), like “Solve 3 + 4”.  
   - After receiving a lesson, share the session link from [Session Detail](/session/[sessionId]) with your child or a tutor.  
   - Your child clones the session to work independently, creating their own copy.

3. **Collaborate on Progress**  
   - Ask your child to share their cloned session link (from their [History](/history)) when they’re ready.  
   - Review their quiz scores and readiness (>90% recommended) together to celebrate progress.

4. **Reward Success**  
   Offer incentives for sharing progress and achieving high readiness scores.

See [Getting Started](/public/docs/getting-started) for detailed setup instructions.

## Rewarding Your Child’s Success 🎉

Motivate your child by celebrating their achievements:

- *Encourage Sharing*: Ask your child to share their session link from [History](/history) to show their progress.  
- *Offer Incentives*: Reward scores >90% or shared progress with fun treats, like a favorite snack or a special outing.  
- *Build Confidence*: Praise their effort to foster a love for learning.

> **Example**: “Amazing job scoring 95% on your math quiz and sharing your progress! Let’s get ice cream to celebrate!” 🍦

## Supporting Your Child’s Learning 🎓

- *Encourage Quizzes*: Promote daily practice to build skills.  
- *Share with Tutors*: Send session links to tutors for review, just as you would with your child.  
- *Explore Subjects*: Check K-12 subjects in [Subjects](/public/docs/subjects).  
- *Learn More*: See [Getting Started](/public/docs/getting-started) for additional tips.

## Troubleshooting

- *Can’t see child’s progress?* Shared sessions don’t appear in [History](/history) until cloned. Ask your child to share their cloned session link.  
- *Session link not working?* Ensure it points to a valid [Session Detail](/session/[sessionId]) page.  
- *Need help?* Use the feedback link on the [main page](/) or email support@k12beast.com.
