# Classroom Guide for Teachers

This guide helps teachers integrate K12Beast into their classrooms to support personalized learning.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Teacher Account**: Sign up at `/signup` to access teacher-specific features.
2. **Set Up a Classroom**: Start a new session at `/chat` and share the session link with students.
3. **Monitor Progress**: Use the `/history` page to review student sessions and quiz results.

## Best Practices

- **Encourage Exploration**: Let students submit problems and explore AI-generated lessons.
- **Use Quizzes**: Request quizzes via the chat interface to assess student understanding.
- **Share with Parents**: Share session links with parents to keep them informed.
